# Windows Common Dialogs

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Zukaritasu/jdialogs) ![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Zukaritasu/jdialogs/total) ![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Zukaritasu/jdialogs)

The jdialogs.jar library contains several classes that display dialog windows such as file chooser, fonts, colors, etc...

All dialog windows are native to the Windows system, so the jdialogs.jar library comes with a DLL to call the necessary native functions using JNI.

This library was not made with the intention of being cross-platform with other operating systems but if you intend to contribute to this project to make it cross-platform or fix any bugs then welcome!!!
